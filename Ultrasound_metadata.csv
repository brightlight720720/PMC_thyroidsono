This case concerns a 48-year-old woman who presented with a palpable left neck mass and occasional dysphagia. She had a history of thyrotoxicosis under medication control, and the last thyroid function test showed euthyroid status. She denied other systemic diseases. Physical examination showed a firm palpable nodule (about 2 cm in diameter) over the left thyroid lobe. Preoperative chest X-ray showed dextrocardia. The ultrasound scan of the neck revealed a left thyroid nodular goiter sized 2.1 × 1.7 cm2 with microcalcification. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was negative for malignant cells. The patient’s head and neck CT revealed not only dextrocardia with right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery, but also left-sided liver and right-sided spleen, suggesting inversus totalis (Figure 1). The patient had a left lobectomy with isthmusectomy. Intraoperatively, a left-sided NRLN was dissected and preserved (Figure 2). Surgical histopathology report confirmed nodular goiter with islands of colloid-filled acini and islands of small hyperplastic acini. There was no sign of hoarseness during the postoperative period and the patient was discharged under stable condition without relative complication. In general, RLN runs into the tracheoesophageal groove, with other routes including the paratracheal area or the paraesophageal area [1]. For head and neck surgery, visualization and preservation of RLN are vital steps to prevent or minimize nerve injury. The NRLN, a rare variant of RLN, imposes a higher surgical risk of nerve injury. In the much rarer case of left NRLN, such as the case of our patient, the whole vascular and nerve development process is enantiomorphic, resulting in the inversus totalis, accompanied by left aberrant subclavian artery and left NRLN [2]. Preoperative identification of aberrant subclavian arteries and NRLNs is essential for reducing the potential risk of nerve damage. Several imaging modalities have shown their potential of preoperative detection of relevant variants. The ultrasonography pattern of the right common carotid artery at its origin level is normally seen as the “Y-sign”, since the right common carotid artery arises from the bifurcation of the brachiocephalic trunk. On the other hand, if the perioperative ultrasonography showed a right common carotid artery arising directly from the aortic arch, the right aberrant right subclavian artery and the associated right NRLN should be suspected [3]. Moreover, preoperative Computed Tomography and CT angiography are safe and convenient tools that can provide more precise images of vascular structure and promote early detection of relative anomalies of aberrant arteries and NRLN.",malignant

This case concerns a 48-year-old woman who presented with a palpable left neck mass and occasional dysphagia. She had a history of thyrotoxicosis under medication control, and the last thyroid function test showed euthyroid status. She denied other systemic diseases. Physical examination showed a firm palpable nodule (about 2 cm in diameter) over the left thyroid lobe. Preoperative chest X-ray showed dextrocardia. The ultrasound scan of the neck revealed a left thyroid nodular goiter sized 2.1 × 1.7 cm2 with microcalcification. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was negative for malignant cells. The patient’s head and neck CT revealed not only dextrocardia with right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery, but also left-sided liver and right-sided spleen, suggesting inversus totalis (Figure 1). The patient had a left lobectomy with isthmusectomy. Intraoperatively, a left-sided NRLN was dissected and preserved (Figure 2). Surgical histopathology report confirmed nodular goiter with islands of colloid-filled acini and islands of small hyperplastic acini. There was no sign of hoarseness during the postoperative period and the patient was discharged under stable condition without relative complication. In general, RLN runs into the tracheoesophageal groove, with other routes including the paratracheal area or the paraesophageal area [1]. For head and neck surgery, visualization and preservation of RLN are vital steps to prevent or minimize nerve injury. The NRLN, a rare variant of RLN, imposes a higher surgical risk of nerve injury. In the much rarer case of left NRLN, such as the case of our patient, the whole vascular and nerve development process is enantiomorphic, resulting in the inversus totalis, accompanied by left aberrant subclavian artery and left NRLN [2]. Preoperative identification of aberrant subclavian arteries and NRLNs is essential for reducing the potential risk of nerve damage. Several imaging modalities have shown their potential of preoperative detection of relevant variants. The ultrasonography pattern of the right common carotid artery at its origin level is normally seen as the “Y-sign”, since the right common carotid artery arises from the bifurcation of the brachiocephalic trunk. On the other hand, if the perioperative ultrasonography showed a right common carotid artery arising directly from the aortic arch, the right aberrant right subclavian artery and the associated right NRLN should be suspected [3]. Moreover, preoperative Computed Tomography and CT angiography are safe and convenient tools that can provide more precise images of vascular structure and promote early detection of relative anomalies of aberrant arteries and NRLN.",malignant

Bone scintigraphy is usually performed to evaluate a wide variety of skeletal abnormalities (1). Tc-99m-labeled diphosphonates have been used for bone scanning as a major diagnostic tool since the beginning of 1970s (2). Tc-99m MDP has rapid blood clearance, excellent in vivo chemical stability, and a high bone-to-soft tissue ratio, thus, it is ideal for bone imaging (3). In the literature, many cases of incidental Tc-99m-MDP uptake by the soft tissue have been reported due to various reasons, both benign (tumoral calcinosis, myositis ossificans) and malignant (sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, metastases) conditions (4,5). Mechanisms leading to increased extraosseous Tc-99m MDP uptake include extracellular fluid expansion, enhanced local vascularity and permeability, and high tissue calcium concentration. The composition of the calcium deposition and the presence of other elements (e.g. iron and magnesium) are important (4). It is known that there may be incidental Tc-99m MDP uptake in the thyroid gland, in calcific thyroid nodules, secondary to biopsy interventions, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma or metastatic thyroid cancer (4,6). In our case, unexpected incidental Tc-99m MDP involvement was presented in a functionally active thyroid nodule. This appearance of Tc-99m MDP uptake in an active thyroid nodule, first demonstrated in this case, is thought to be secondary to the presence of microcalcifications in the nodule",malignant

A 69-year-old female patient with the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism; hypercalcemia and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and additional multinodular goiter was referred to our department for labeling for the radioguided surgery. The patient had anamnesis of bilateral total thyroidectomy due to multinodular goiter and an additional failed surgery for the parathyroid adenoma excision due to the ectopic localization of adenoma. She had previous diagnosis of incidental papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid gland. Persistent hipercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism were observed after the two operative procedures. Parathyroid scintigraphy was performed by intravenous injection of 370 mBq Tc-99m MIBI with low energy high resolution collimator equipped double head SPECT gamma camera prior to the surgery. The clear demonstration of a parathyroid adenoma in planar images obviated the need for SPECT imaging. The patient was referred to the operation after scintigraphy imaging for radioguided surgery with handheld gamma probe. In the operation room, the background count per minute (cpm) level was 5 from the shoulder and postoperative field count was 200 and the count of the lesion was 1500 cpm. The lesion was between the trachea and esophagus (retroesophageal) and the surgery was performed by a small incision of 2 cm wide. The lesion which was confirmed as a parathyroid adenoma by the pathology result was 2,704 gram in weight and 3 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm in size. Successful removal was confirmed both by postoperative counts and quick PTH analysis (preoperative: 698 pg/mg postoperative: 70.9 pg/mg (normal values: PTH 14-74 pg/mg). No complication was observed during or after the surgery. The patient was normocalcemic after six months of follow up. The definition of minimal invasive parathyroidectomy includes focused surgery planned for the excision of a single enlarged parathyroid gland (1). Routine parathyroid surgery includes inspection and exploration of all the neck, however in recent years the dissemination of imaging methods has contributed to development of this novel surgical approach (minimal invasive surgery) which is a targeted and secure way of successful surgery. Minimally invasive procedures are more comfortable for both the surgeon and the patient due to the cost effectiveness, being safe in terms of complications, and reduced operation, recovery and hospitalization times. Ectopic parathyroid adenoma is a diagnostic challenge which may be located in anywhere between angle of mandibule and mediastinum (2). Approximately 70% of the patients that have failed surgery are due to the ectopic localization of the parathyroid adenoma (3). Most of the upper mediastinal lesions might be excised by a cervical incision (4). However, preoperative localization methods are necessary for successful result (5). Currently the most accurate and reliable method for the localization of the parathyroid adenoma is the parathyroid scintigraphy with additional ultrasonography. Planar parathyroid scintigraphy achieves a sensitivity of 78% and with additional SPECT imaging this ratio increases to 96% according to the previous reports (6). There is limited number of reports of the radioguided surgery for mediastinal lesions. In a previous report, Doğan et al. (7) considered gamma probe as a useful method for ectopic parathyroid adenoma operation. Also in a previous series involving minimal invasive procedures of 102 patients, radioguided surgery was found to be an efficient method, especially in the upper mediastinal lesions (8). The reported patient in this study had a successful surgery and excellent outcome after her third operation without any complications. This case reports shows that minimal invasive radioguided surgery is also possible and required for the patients with history of multiple previous neck explorations and upper mediastinal lesions.",malignant

No typical findings suggestive of parathyroid carcinoma like mitosis, atypia or vascular invasion were observed (hematoxylin and eosin, magnification x400).Preoperatively, serum parathormone (PTH) was 1876 pg/mL, Ca was 10.14 mg/dL and P was 5.02 mg/dL. Following the operation, serum PTH level dropped to 99 pg/mL and serum Ca level was 9.7 mg/dL.Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is mostly caused by hyperplasia and rarely by adenoma (1). Atypical parathyroid adenoma is a rare entity with borderline pathological characteristics, between adenoma and carcinoma (2). Parathyroid surgery is a relatively hard procedure as it necessitates surgical skill and experience. The use of Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy is well established for patients undergoing reoperation for hyperparathyroidism. Some surgeons tend to skip preoperative imaging in secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism because bilateral neck exploration is needed anyway, but some studies suggested that parathyroid scintigraphy could be of value before initial parathyroidectomy (3,4). Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy may help recognize an unexpected appearance of an ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid gland, as well as show the gland with the least radiotracer accumulation that can be autotransplanted. Protocol of parathyroid scan is argued to be important. Although dual isotope techniques are reported to be superior to dual phase imaging and SPECT/CT is recommended strongly to provide topographic anatomic information, in this case, both four pathological glands could still be identified by dual phase Tc-99m MIBI SPECT (5). Ultrasonography (USG) and Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy are complementary in parathyroid imaging. The success of both modalities is similar in single gland disease. However, in case of multiglandular disease, frequently seen in secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, they have been reported to have lower sensitivities. Thus, especially in these patients, combination of scintigraphic and sonographic imaging provides a more accurate approach in the preoperative evaluation (6).In our case, MIBI was capable of detecting atypical adenomas in four parathyroid glands with respect to one gland demonstrated by USG. This report is interesting in the way that atypical adenomas of parathyroid gland were presented in all four of the glands in a patient with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and that the only preoperative method that could address multiglandular disease was Tc-99m MIBI SPECT.",malignant

Routine parathyroid surgery includes inspection and exploration of all the neck, however in recent years the dissemination of imaging methods has contributed to development of this novel surgical approach (minimal invasive surgery) which is a targeted and secure way of successful surgery. Minimally invasive procedures are more comfortable for both the surgeon and the patient due to the cost effectiveness, being safe in terms of complications, and reduced operation, recovery and hospitalization times. Ectopic parathyroid adenoma is a diagnostic challenge which may be located in anywhere between angle of mandibule and mediastinum (2). Approximately 70% of the patients that have failed surgery are due to the ectopic localization of the parathyroid adenoma (3). Most of the upper mediastinal lesions might be excised by a cervical incision (4). However, preoperative localization methods are necessary for successful result (5). Currently the most accurate and reliable method for the localization of the parathyroid adenoma is the parathyroid scintigraphy with additional ultrasonography. Planar parathyroid scintigraphy achieves a sensitivity of 78% and with additional SPECT imaging this ratio increases to 96% according to the previous reports (6). There is limited number of reports of the radioguided surgery for mediastinal lesions. In a previous report, Doğan et al. (7) considered gamma probe as a useful method for ectopic parathyroid adenoma operation. Also in a previous series involving minimal invasive procedures of 102 patients, radioguided surgery was found to be an efficient method, especially in the upper mediastinal lesions (8). The reported patient in this study had a successful surgery and excellent outcome after her third operation without any complications. This case reports shows that minimal invasive radioguided surgery is also possible and required for the patients with history of multiple previous neck explorations and upper mediastinal lesions.",malignant
